# HAOS - Hypotetical Architecure Operating System

- This is a hypotetical operating system that I'm developing on top
      of the Hypotetical Architecure created by the professor Eduardo Molina Cruz
      on the course of Computer Architecture.

- This arquitecture is tha same used on the simulator HASS(Hypotetical Architecure Simulator System).
